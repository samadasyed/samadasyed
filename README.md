## Welcome to my GitHub 👋

My name is Samad, I'm a fourth year computer science student at UW-Madison. I've spent the last couple years building software, playing around with different operating systems, teaching computer science theory, and just trying my best to be the best engineer I can be. 

## Disclaimer
Unfortunately I don't maintain my personal github that much. Most of my work is closed source. So most of my repos on here are either private or projects/notes I am allowed to open source. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring MMA, history, philosophy, sci-fi, and poetry.
I'd be happy to connect with anyone here as well! Just message me on Linkedin.
