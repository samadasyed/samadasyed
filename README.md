## Welcome to my GitHub 👋

My name is Samad, I'm a fourth year computer science student at UW-Madison. I've spent the last couple years building software, exploring different parts of the stack, teaching computer science theory, and just trying my best to be the best dev I can be. 

## Disclaimer
Unfortunately most of my work is closed source, a combination of my university's policies and working with intellectual property. So most of my repos on here are private. Recently I have been making some projects/notes public as my university time ends. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring MMA, history, philosophy, sci-fi, and poetry.
I'd be happy to connect with anyone here as well! Just message me on Linkedin.
